      "explanation": "CoroutineContext is like a Map<CoroutineContext.Key, Element> with the + operator, where the constructor is private. You can't directly create a CoroutineContext() \n(which would be an empty Map), you can only create CoroutineContext by creating an Element (and add more Elements to it).\nThis works, because Element implements the CoroutineContext interface. So, in 2 you have a CoroutineContext with a CoroutineName Element,\nand in 3 you have a CoroutineContext with a CoroutineName and a Job Element.",

      "explanation": "Because CoroutineContext works like a Map<CoroutineContext.Key, Element> (every Element has a CoroutineContext.Key), adding the same Element that it already has will replace the previous. So the first line will be CoroutineName(name2).\nThe CoroutineScope creates a Job for the coroutine, so the next line will be something like StandaloneCoroutine{Active}@3745d7f8.\nThe launch() method adds the default dispatcher (Dispatcher.Default) to the context, if no Dispatcher is defined (by calling CoroutineScope.newCoroutineContext(context: CoroutineContext)). So the next line will be Dispatchers.Default\nIf the context doesn’t have a CoroutineExceptionHandler, then the global handler is used (but not installed in the context).\nNote: Jobs and Dispatchers can't be added to one another.",
